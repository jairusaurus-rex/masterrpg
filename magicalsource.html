		<h1>Magical Source</h1>
		<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Getting the highest spell levels is nearly impossible on your own. Also, your spells are known and mana is very limited. To aid this, your magic can come from another source other than your own merit. “Magic Source“ is a complex Feat that requires its own chapter. Once you select the feat “Magic Source” you must pick one of the following types of magic source: Totem, Familiar, Spellbook, Pact, bloodline, a prodigy. &nbsp;This gives you an added benefit to your magic through your Grit, Focus, Intelligence, Wit, Charisma, or aura respectively. You add this Ability score to the following</span></p>

To get to a new tier of magic in any magic feat, you now add Aura plus your new ability from your magic source. The two combined now have to equal the Magic tier. Without this, you can only use your Aura to meet this requirement</span></li><li class="c5 c19"><span class="c2">Add your new ability to your mana amount</span></li><li class="c5 c19"><span class="c2">Add your new ability to your Spells Known</span></li><li class="c5 c19"><span class="c2">Add your new ability to your Worthiness </span></li><li class="c5 c19"><span class="c2">Add your new ability to your Mana recovery</span></li></ul>

		<div id=Spellbook class="flippage" style="display:none">
			<h1>Spellbook (Intelligence)</h1>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">You have given up on knowing spells known and gain a spellbook that holds as many spells as you can find. You lose “Spells Known” and anything that affects “Spells Known” does not affect you. You gain “Spells Prepared” and start with one “spellbook”</span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Upon choosing this Magic Source, you gain one free spell book that can starts with twice your *I plus twice your total magical tiers. You also gain, for free, 2 spells in your spell book when you gain a magic tier. You must be able to cast any spell you put in your book. </span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">You can invent as many spells as you want. These additional spells added to your spellbook take more time. You must take one hour per spell level of the spell you are inventing. In the end, you must make a spellcraft check again 10 + the spell level of the spell you are copying. If failed, your time is lost, if won, you gain a new spell in your spellbook. </span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">Like all spells in your spellbook, you can only make spells at a spell level you can cast.. </span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">You can buy more spellbooks. To copy from one of your spellbooks to another is easier because it is a spell you have worked with before in your own handwriting. It takes half the time and you don’t have to make a spellcraft check. </span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">You can only cast spells you have in your spells prepared list. It takes one minute per spell level to add a spell from your spellbook to your spells prepared list. It takes half that time to remove a spell from your spells prepared list. You can take an hour to add or remove as many spells from your spell list as you want. You can only a number of spells in your prepared spell list up to *I plus your bonus </span></p>

		<div id=Pact class="flippage" style="display:none">
			<h1>Pact (Wit)</h1>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">You follow a code, mythical creature, deity, or religion. You pick one or two of the domains including Good, Neutral, Evil, Order, Chaos. You can choose one, two or three Pact features from those domains. The number of Pact Features determines how close you are with the source of your. Bewared, that your Game Master is in ultimate control of the source of your power and the more Pact Features you take, the more control your Game Master will have over your character. Unlike other Magic Sources, you can lose all features and benefits Magic Source Pact if you don’t follow the source. </span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c2">You gain a number of Pact Points equal to your bonus plus your W plus the amount of pact features you choose (one, two, or three). You regain all lost Pact Points after a rest</span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c23">One.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you choose only one Pact feature, you are an active member or some religion, or other group. An example is a priest of a religion or a member of a druid order. Your magic comes from one such power like gods, nature, or perhaps the religious belief itself. You follow a code of that religion or order which you must decide with your Game Master. You can break the codes if you want and your magic will be fine, however the religion or order might treat you poorly or people might see you are a hypocrite. Repeated offences that show that you have thrown away the code will cause you to lose your magic source. You can reclaim your powers if you find a superior in the order or faith you have and do as they say.</span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c23">Two. </span><span class="c2">If you choose two Pact Features, You have taken an oath to some being, or order, or cause. You follow a code strictly. Some examples is a paladin knight of a holy order, a devout protected of the forest, or a Any Clear breaking of that code will cause you to lose your magic source. You can reclaim your powers if a large act of redemption.</span></p>
			<p class="c5"><span class="c23">Three. </span><span class="c2">If you choose three Pact Features, you work for the entity directly. The entity can give you instructions whenever it wishes. The Entity will generally follow the domain that it comes from. Failure to do as it asks results in the loss of all Pact Features. You can reclaim your powers by doing as the entity asks. </span></p>
