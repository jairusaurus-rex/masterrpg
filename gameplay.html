			<h1>Action Economy</h1>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Spent and Ready action: </span><span class="c6">During combat, every player gets four actions to use how they seem fit: Major, Move, Minor, and Reaction. These either have the status of Spent or Ready. Once one is Spent, it is considered Spent until the start of your turn therefore you cannot use them again. </span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c6">At the start of combat, reaction is considered Ready and the rest are considered Spent. At the start of your turn, unless you are disoriented, all actions are turned to Ready. This is the VERY FIRST thing that happens in your turn. &nbsp;</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c6">Except to react, your actions must be used on your turn. You can use any of your actions in any order unless specified by the action act. You must show what action is Spent for what action act. To keep track of this, we recommend using cards and flipping them over when Spent. </span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Action Rankings: </span><span class="c6">Actions have ranking. A higher ranked actions can be spent on a lower one. When doing this, the higher ranked one is still used and still only uses one thing on the lower ranked action list. This is trading down and is at the players choice. For example, you can move with your move action then move again using your major action, therefore doubling your speed that turn.</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c6">You cannot trade up in actions. For example, a move action cannot be spent on a major action. However, you can gain feats that would lower an act to a lower rank action.</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c6">The ranking goes as follows. A major action is the top rank action followed by the move action followed by the minor action followed by reaction.</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Movement:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Your character has a speed movement. Whenever you move at your speed, always round up to the nearest 5. If your speed is 22, you can treat that speed as though you can move 25 feet. </span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c6">If anything halves your speed, have your actual speed first then round up to the nearest 5. If your speed is 22 and you must half you speed for any reason, your speed is now 11 and you can treat that half speed as 15 feet.</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Reaction triggers</span><span class="c6">: reactions act can only be used when something triggers the act. Even if you can trade down and use multiple reactions, you can still only use one reaction per trigger. See reaction descriptions for more details.</span></p>
			<h1>Major Actions</h1>

You must make a Medicine check against the number of negative hit points. If successful, that ally's hit points return to 0. If unsuccessful, that ally takes one damage.</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Grapple</span><span>: If an enemy is within reach you can attempt to make a grapple check against the enemies grapple check. If successful you can do one of the following. Put the enemy in the Grappled condition. Escape the grappled condition. If the enemy is already in the grappled condition, put them in the pinned condition. </span><span class="c14">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">If you are in the pinned condition, escape to the grappled position. </span></p>

			<p class="c4"><span>Players and enemies react the same way unless specified. Rules applying to players apply to enemies and vise versa. </span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Initiative: &nbsp;</span><span class="c6">All players and creatures roll initiative and follow their turns in that order. </span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Attacking: </span><span class="c6">When attacking, make the check assigned on the weapon. The enemy must make a defense move. You can only attack with a weapon you have in hand. You can Strike with your hands or feet or any other natural attack.</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Defense: </span><span class="c6">When making a defense move, choose either Dodge or Armor Skill check. The attacker must beat that check with their attack to do damage. </span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c6">An attacker can force the roll if an act states directly that you must roll a dodge or must roll an armor, you must roll that skill check. </span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c6">If you make an armor check without wearing armor, your check is nulled.</span></p>
			<p class="c4"><span class="c14">Damage: </span><span class="c6">If the attack is successful, you deal the damage listed in the weapon along with any benefit given by feats. Unless one has damage immunity, damage always does at least one point.</span></p>

If it is an attack or a spell that targets an enemy, you can make the skill check nulled. </span></p>
